# STORE INVENTORY SYSTEM
## Introduction

A store with various types of shoes needs an inventory system to keep track of the stock they have with its prices, SKU numbers, availability, etc.
Python classes were used to design this system.

# Shoe Inventory Management System

The Shoe Inventory Management System is a simple program designed to help manage shoe inventory for a store. It allows users to capture new shoes into inventory, view all shoes, restock shoes, change the cost of a shoe, search for a specific shoe, display the stock value of each shoe, and display shoes for sale based on the highest quantity available.

## Features

- **Capture Shoes**: Add new shoes to the inventory by providing details such as country of manufacture, SKU code, product name, cost per pair, and quantity.
- **View All Shoes**: Display a tabulated view of all shoes in the inventory.
- **Re-stock Shoes**: Re-stock shoes by updating the quantity of existing shoe entries in the inventory.
- **Change Cost**: Modify the cost of a shoe in the inventory.
- **Search Shoe**: Search for a specific shoe in the inventory by entering its SKU code.
- **Display Stock Value**: Calculate and display the stock value of each shoe in the inventory.
- **Display Shoes for Sale**: Identify and display shoes with the highest quantity available, indicating they are for sale.

## Usage

1. Run the program:
```python shoe_inventory.py```
2. Choose from the available options to perform actions such as capturing shoes, viewing inventory, restocking, etc.

## Data Persistence

The shoe inventory data is stored in a text file named "inventory.txt" in CSV format. Each line represents a shoe entry with fields separated by commas.
